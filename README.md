### JPACRUDProject

### Description:
The task for this project was to build a website, front end, and back end from the ground up. Starting with the creation of the database, MySQL Workbench was used to create the database, the tables, and the EER diagram. From that point the information was forward engineered and the information was accessible from either the terminal or MySWQL Workbench.

The next steps were to create an entity class with its fields, a JpaImpl that implemented an interface, and a controller. These steps were pretty straight forward but lead to a more complex portion of the project and that was mapping out all of the necessary JSP files.

The user will be able to access the website, explore National Parks, search for a National Park by its park id, update the park, or delete the park. They will also have the option to create their own National Park where they will have the option to update or delete as well.

# Lessons Learned:
The main takeaway from completing this project was that I can lean on Spring way more than I did. I found myself overthinking things and wanting to apply methods learned previously that are now unnecessary. I also learned a valuable lesson in properly naming methods and ".do's". Taking the time in the beginning of the project to map everything out and give appropriate names to things would have saved me a lot of time. I also need to take a deep dive into CSS so I will have a better understanding of how and where things can be manipulated. Lastly, I learned that I need to find a balance in regards to my approach to each project. Throughout this course I've learned so much so when a project gets assigned my immediate reaction is to start planning the ULTIMATE project and I tend to get lost in the sauce a little bit. The most important thing is to get a minimum viable product that passes all of the project requirements. Once that task is complete I can then implement the other ideas that I had. In the future, I will take a step back and have a more controlled and methodical approach.
